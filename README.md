# 🏴‍☠️ Guess Who: One Piece Edition 🏴‍☠️

Welcome to **Guess Who: One Piece Edition**! This project is a fun, interactive version of the classic *Guess Who* game, but with your favorite characters from the *One Piece* anime and manga series. It's a guessing game where two players take turns asking yes-or-no questions to deduce the identity of the other player's hidden character.

## 🚀 Features

- **Wide character selection**: Play with a variety of *One Piece* characters, each with their own unique traits.
- **Random character assignment**: Players are assigned a random character at the start of each game.
- **Yes/No question mechanic**: Ask questions about character traits (e.g., "Is your character a pirate?" or "Does your character have a scar?").
- **Simple, intuitive UI**: A user-friendly interface makes it easy for anyone to play, whether they are familiar with *One Piece* or not.

## 📜 How to Play

1. **Start the game**: Each player is assigned a random *One Piece* character.
2. **Take turns asking questions**: Ask your opponent yes-or-no questions to narrow down the list of possible characters.
   - Example questions:
     - "Is your character part of the Straw Hat crew?"
     - "Does your character have a Devil Fruit power?"
     - "Is your character a Marine?"
3. **Guess the character**: When you think you know who your opponent's character is, make a guess!
4. **Win the game**: The first player to guess the opponent's character wins!
